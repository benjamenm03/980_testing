## Arduino

This class uses a library published through the Arduino IDE to hold the starter code for each lab. View the library reference for ENGR100-980 [here](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/engr100-980/).

View the library status from Arduino [here](https://downloads.arduino.cc/libraries/logs/github.com/engin100/980/). This is useful for monitoring builds and deployments of new versions.

## Rocket Boards

The KiCAD files for the PCBs we print and launch in model rockets can be found [here](https://github.com/engin100/980-rocket-boards).
