## Written Questions

1. Do drag force and terminal velocity change with mass? How?

2. Do the drag force and terminal velocity change with parachute size? How?

3. Plot your experimentally determined terminal velocities along with the theoretical terminal velocity calculated in the spreadsheet and the analytically calculated terminal velocities from your terminal velocity equation for your varying parameter. (Hint: create a small table of these projected values as you vary your parameter. You will have three different lines on the plot!)

4. Why do we have you time from the second bridge instead of from the moment it drops? (Think about the kinematic equations about velocity). Compare your calculation of the time-dependent position and velocity to the assumption we made. Does this make sense?

5. At what altitude does the parachute reach terminal velocity? Does this depend on your parameter you chose to vary? How?

## Deliverables

### Page 1

- First page of a memo advising management about the difference you saw between experimental and calculated values (this is an individual assignment, even though the lab works in partners).

  - You are writing to Dr. Ridley and Dr. Hogg.
  
  - Your foreward should set up what you are doing and why it is important (you can be a little creative for your organizational problem - not just "we are doing this because the professors told us to" - imagine some real world scenario where you are testing parachutes).

  - Your summary should give the results of your experiment, interpret them, and then come to a conclusion about the difference between experimental and calculated results.

  - You can create your own letterhead or use the standard one on Canvas.

  - Figures (your plots) can follow after page one, and can be referred to in your summary, should you like. Same with answers to the written questions.

  - Figures should follow Tech Comm best practices from lecture.

### Page 2

- A plot of terminal velocity vs your variable (mass or parachute size) following Tech Comm guidelines from class.

- Include data for at least 4 unique values of your chosen parameter for experimental data points, and have one trend line each for your experimental, analytical, and numerical results.

- Answers to written questions.
