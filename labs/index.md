# Labs

As we publish labs, they will become available here.

## Lab 1: Arduino 101

Learning how to program and wire an Arduino micro-controller to control LEDs on a breadboard.

## Lab 4: Creating a Standalone Arduino

Saving Arduino sensor data to a microSD card to that we can use it later, and powering an Arduino with a battery.

:warning: This *may* come in handy when launching rockets...
